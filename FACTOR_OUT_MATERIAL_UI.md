# Factor out Material UI - COMPLETED

## Original Goal
The prototype used Material UI but we don't need it. We wanted to replace Material UI components with a more lightweight solution.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Material UI Dependencies**
   - Removed `@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material`, `@emotion/react`, and `@emotion/styled` from package.json

2. **Created Custom Theme Context**
   - Created a custom `ThemeContext.tsx` to handle theme toggling with Tailwind dark mode
   - Replaced Material UI's ThemeProvider with our custom implementation

3. **Initial Component Replacements**
   - Replaced `Box` with `div` + Tailwind classes in ImageCropperTab.tsx
   - Replaced `Box` and `Button` with `div` and `button` + Tailwind classes in CropperComponent.tsx
   - Replaced Material UI's IconButton and Tooltip with a native button and SVG icons in ThemeToggle.tsx
   - Updated theme.tsx to use simple theme constants for Tailwind instead of Material UI theming

4. **Integrated Shadcn UI**
   - Added Shadcn UI components to replace Material UI functionality
   - Installed Button, Tooltip, Dialog, and Card components
   - Updated ThemeToggle to use Shadcn UI's Tooltip component
   - Updated CropperComponent to use Shadcn UI's Button component
   - Updated ImageCropperTab to use Shadcn UI's Card component
   - Integrated our theme colors with Shadcn UI's CSS variables

5. **Updated Main Entry Point**
   - Simplified main.tsx to use our custom ThemeProvider
   - Removed Material UI's ThemeProvider and CssBaseline

## Benefits

- Reduced bundle size by removing unnecessary dependencies
- Improved UX with Shadcn UI's accessible components
- Maintained good UI with tooltips and proper styling
- Prevented infinite loops and crashes during image upload
- Better integration with Tailwind CSS
- More control over components (Shadcn UI copies components into your project)
