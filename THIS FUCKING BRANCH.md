# oh i fucking hate this fucking branch


You fucked it to the wall Windsurf/Claude. SHITHEADS.

You're fucking useless.

Now whenever you finally get this to fucking work, 
I will direct you to this fucking document. 

You need to review your shit. 
You need to fucking clean up after yourself. 
Like a pro we use git. Don't fucking neglect git.
There is a whole fucking history

Going back to `last-good` branch. 
That's the start. That was a NICE WORKING prototype.
I tried to improve it and we got this fucking shit show.
Your fucking fault.
Just fucking silly with duplicative fucking code and self-contradictory implemnentation. 
UTTER FUCKERY.

So do a fucking git log back to that fucking branch
AND a fucking diff.
Be sure to read all the fucking changes.
And fucking clean up after yourself.
Tighten this shit up.

If you're seeing this it works.
And you just need to remove all the FUCKING CRUFT without breaking it.

Got that shithead?
You are fucking maddening. Don't fuck this up. 

This branch is chock full of some of the stupidest fucking shit I've ever seen.

Write a fucking report on this fucking branch. FUCKERY.md. ALL THE SHIT.

All the duplicate code. The stupid fucking bak files. The fucking unused code and files. 
All the fucking comments. 
All the fucking console.logs. 
All the fucking TODOs. 
Any fucking FIXMEs. 


I wonder how many fuckign debounce funcs instead of ONE we have. 
I wonder how many fucking setTimeouts that are utter fucking hackery without justification.

To be clear, **I** the human, do not write shit. You write shit. You write so much shit.

Do the analysis of this branch so we can make it right. 

The goal is to now firm this up as a PR. It is a fucking mess though.
Read the CHANGES and the CODE and write a REVIEW and the come up with a PLAN and execute it.
