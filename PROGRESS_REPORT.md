# Progress Report on Crop Images Project

## Initial Problem
- Infinite update loop in the crop stats update system
- Duplicate calls to `updateCropStats` in both zoom and crop event handlers
- Incorrect import paths (`qualityUtils` and `cropperUtils` didn't exist)
- Build errors due to incorrect imports

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Paths
- Changed imports from non-existent files:
  - `import { checkZoomQuality } from '../utils/qualityUtils'`
  - `import { getScale, updateConstraintsForScale } from '../utils/cropperUtils'`
- To correct import:
  - `import { getScale, updateConstraintsForScale, checkZoomQuality } from '../utils/cropperScaleUtils'`

### 2. Fixed Infinite Update Loop
- Removed duplicate calls to `updateCropStats` in both zoom and crop handlers
- Ensured only one update call per event cycle
- Removed unnecessary debounced calls and redundant state updates
- Added forced timestamp updates for reactivity

### 3. Fixed Function Signature Issues
- Changed `useCropItem` hook signature from accepting object `{ file, index }` to just `index`
- Then reverted back to original signature when this caused black box issue
- Attempted to fix file handling in the hook

### 4. Cleanup Issues
- Fixed cleanup effect to properly revoke object URLs
- Ensured proper destruction of cropper instances

## Current State
- Build is successful but images render as black boxes
- Function signature and file handling in `useCropItem` hook is problematic
- Tried to restore original function signature but didn't properly fix the file handling

## Issues to Address
1. Fix the black box rendering issue - likely related to how files are being handled in the `useCropItem` hook
2. Ensure proper cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks
3. Maintain the fixes for the infinite update loop
4. Clean up cruft including:
   - Duplicate code
   - Backup files (.bak, .fixed)
   - Unused code and files
   - Excessive comments
   - Console logs
   - TODOs and FIXMEs
   - Multiple debounce implementations
   - Unnecessary timeouts

## Last Known Working State
- We had fixed the import paths and infinite update loop
- The build was successful
- But the image rendering was broken (black box)

## Next Steps
1. Fix the image rendering issue by properly handling files in the `useCropItem` hook
2. Verify that the infinite update loop fix is still working
3. Clean up all cruft as per your instructions
4. Write a comprehensive FUCKERY.md report documenting all issues found
